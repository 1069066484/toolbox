Documentation: https://pdollar.github.io/toolbox/
Recently I'm doing something related to sketch token extraction(https://github.com/gitlim/SketchTokens) and piotr's toolbox should be pre-installed. However, differences between OS's bring many errors and bugs. Most of them exist in the C/C++ codes. So I fixed the codes for my work. The compiler I used is VS2017(64bit). Hopefully I can help your installation. I'm not sure whether all bugs have been fixed, but the modification is expected to be similar.
